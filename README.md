A humble project by me (Abdallah Elbeheiry) and Youssef atef made to solve various types of equations with different methods, for Cairo university faculty of science

Note: Equations written cannot be in form U = V, as the program assumes the equation is equal to zero, so the correct form is U - V and the program will interpret it as U - V = 0
